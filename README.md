Ice Hockey World Championship (App)

Description

  An app that holds information regarding the 2021 Ice Hockey World Championship held in Riga, Latvia. It has information about the 16 participating teams (countries) and allows users to keep up with their favorite team. Hockey fans wonâ€™t be able to see the games on the spot so for them it is important to always be able to see what is happening on and off the ice. The official IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) app is not always working and does not always hold the information that fans are expecting to see. So it is important to give them access to the important information regarding the Championship.
